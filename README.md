# EQ2443-2445-Project-Group2
This is the code we used to run GNURadio(https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio) 
and gr-ieee802-11(https://github.com/bastibl/gr-ieee802-11).
We made some changes to the gr-ieee802-11 frame equalizer to add the CSI data to a header so we could extract that information.
Also changed gr_read_file_metadata to read the metadata live.
