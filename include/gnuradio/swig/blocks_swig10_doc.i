Unlike the peak detectors, you must the now the absolute height of the plateau. Whenever the amplitude exceeds the given threshold, it starts assuming the presence of a plateau.

No bits are lost here; any value for k and l (within [1, 8]) is allowed. On every fresh input byte, it starts reading on the LSB, and starts copying to the LSB as well.

When supplying a tag name, this block operates on tagged streams. In this case, it can happen that the input data or the output data becomes unaligned when k * input length is not equal to l * output length. In this case, the  parameter is used to decide which data packet to align.

Usually,  is false for unpacking (k=8, l < 8) and false for reversing that.


Example
Say you're tx'ing 8-PSK and therefore set k=8, l=3 on the transmit side before the modulator. Now assume you're transmitting a single byte of data. Your incoming tagged stream has length 1, the outgoing has length 3. However, the third item is actually only carrying 2 bits of relevant data, the bits do not align with the boundaries. So you set  = false, because the output can be unaligned.

Now say you're doing the inverse: packing those three items into full bytes. How do you interpret those three bytes? Without this flag, you'd have to assume there's 9 relevant bits in there, so you'd end up with 2 bytes of output data. But in the packing case, you want the  to be aligned; all output bits must be useful. By asserting this flag, the packing algorithm tries to do this and in this case assumes that since we have alignment after 8 bits, the 9th can be discarded.

This block otherwise acts as a NULL sink in that items from the input stream are ignored. It is designed to be able to attach to any block and watch all tags streaming out of that block for debugging purposes.

Specifying a key will allow this block to filter out all other tags and only display tags that match the given key. This can help clean up the output and allow you to focus in on a particular tag of interest.

The vector source can also produce stream tags with the data. Pass in a vector of gr::tag_t objects and they will be emitted based on the specified offset of the tag.

A python dictionary can also be used using the keys: \"offset\", \"key\", \"value\", and \"srcid\" with the same data types as for the lists.

%feature("docstring") gr::blocks::control_loop "A second-order control loop implementation class.

This class implements a second order control loop and is inteded to act as a parent class to blocks which need a control loop (e.g., gr::digital::costas_loop_cc, gr::analog::pll_refout_cc, etc.). It takes in a loop bandwidth as well as a max and min frequency and provides the functions that control the update of the loop.

The loop works of alpha and beta gains. These gains are calculated using the input loop bandwidth and a pre-set damping factor. The damping factor can be changed using the set_damping_factor after the block is constructed. The alpha and beta values can be set using their respective set_alpha or set_beta functions if very precise control over these is required.

The class tracks both phase and frequency of a signal based on an error signal. The error calculation is unique for each algorithm and is calculated externally and passed to the advance_loop function, which uses this to update its phase and frequency estimates.

This class also provides the functions phase_wrap and frequency_limit to easily keep the phase and frequency estimates within our set bounds (phase_wrap keeps it within +/-2pi)."

This function should be called after advance_loop to keep the phase in a good operating region. It is set as a separate method in case another way is desired as this is fairly heavy-handed."

%feature("docstring") gr::blocks::control_loop::frequency_limit "Keep the frequency between d_min_freq and d_max_freq.
